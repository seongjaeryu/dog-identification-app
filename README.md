# <p align="center">CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier</p>

## Project Overview

Dog breed classifier is one of the popular CNN(convolutional neural network) projects. The main problem is to identify a dog breed from an input image. It also needs to be identified whether it is an image of a dog or not. In case when a given input is identified as an image with a human face, a similar dog breed will be provided.

This idea is based on supervised machine learning with a multi-class classification problem. The intention of this model is to deploy APIs and build an application with the APIs.

## Problem Statement

The problem is to build a dog breed classification model and deploy this model for an application.

-   Dog-image identifier: Inferring whether it is a dog image or not from an input image.
-   Dog-breed classifier: Inferring a dog breed from an input image.
-   Human-face-image identifier: Inferring whether it is a human face image or not from an input image.
-   Human-face-image Resemble-dog classifier: Inferring a dog breed, resembling a human face input image.
